# Military Atheletic Web Application(MAWA) ‚öΩ
 
 Military Atheletic Web Application(MAWA) is a website including key features such as authentication, authorization, CRUD, comment function and information page. We used Flask web-framework, sqlalchemy database, and AWS EC2 instance to launch services. See demo @ https://athleticwebapp.shawngitman.repl.co/main (üëà Click!)

## Prerequisites & Environmanet

* Python (3.8.2)
* Flask
* Flask-SQLAlchemy
* Amazon Linux AMI 2018.03.0 (HVM), SSD Volume Type - type : t2.large, network performance : Low to midium, vCPU : 2, Ipv4 support : available
* Visual Studio Code

## Installing

Step One : Clone the repo without checking out a work tree.
```
git clone -n https://github.com/Shawn-gitman/Athletic_Web_Application
```
Step Two : check out the file.
```
git checkout master -- path/within/repo/to/file
```

## Running the tests

* Run main.py to implement Athletic_Web_Application. Enroll membership from enroll box in 0.0.0.0/main. As soon as, user registered to this web-application, find menu_icon on right-top to access login service(0.0.0.0/login). Users are available to use CRUD(create, read, update, delete) service by entering third option from the navigation bar. Writing comments are available for each post whenever users intended. All comment datas are deleted as the post had deleted. See roulette service(0.0.0.0/lottery) from fourth option, to set up strngth(Low, midium, high) and start running the feature.

## Built With

* Python (3.8.2) : Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
* Flask : Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.[3] It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools. Extensions are updated far more frequently than the core Flask program.
* Flask-SQLAlcehmy : SQLAlchemy is an open-source SQL toolkit and object-relational mapper (ORM) for the Python programming language released under the MIT License.
* EC2(Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud) : EC2 is a part of Amazon.com's cloud-computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), that allows users to rent virtual computers on which to run their own computer applications. EC2 encourages scalable deployment of applications by providing a web service through which a user can boot an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to configure a virtual machine, which Amazon calls an "instance", containing any software desired. A user can create, launch, and terminate server-instances as needed, paying by the second for active servers ‚Äì hence the term "elastic". EC2 provides users with control over the geographical location of instances that allows for latency optimization and high levels of redundancy.
* Visual Studio Code : Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes embedded Git and support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring. It is highly customizable, allowing users to change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality. The source code is free and open-source, released under the permissive MIT License. The compiled binaries are freeware for any use.
